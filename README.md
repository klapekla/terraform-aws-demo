# Terraform AWS Demo

This git repo contains infrastructure as code (terraform) to deploy a standard architecture to AWS.

## Usage

```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

In my demo AWS access_key and secret_key will be automatically loaded from ~/.aws/credentials since i have set that up previously
